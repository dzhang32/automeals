# automeals

`automeals` is a web application that semi-automates weekly meal planning. It is intended to be used in combination with [autogroceries](https://github.com/dzhang32/autogroceries), which automates grocery shopping.

The frontend is built using `React` (with the help of [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview)) and the backend is built using `fastapi`. 

Both frontend and backend are deployed for free through [Render](https://render.com/). The free-tier spins down after a period inactivity, so you may experience a  30s-1min start-up delay when visiting [automeals](https://automeals.onrender.com).
